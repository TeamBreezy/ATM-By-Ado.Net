# ATM-By-Ado.Net
This is a project called the Bank, but it is different and divided into three parts
The first part is a program that the manager works with in order to add employees, give them permissions and record their data
And another program that the employee works with in order to add customers, record their data, record the deposit and withdrawal movement made by the customer, and display his account statement.
And another program that the customer works with in the ATM machine on the street, from which he withdraws the required amount if he has sufficient balance in the bank.
